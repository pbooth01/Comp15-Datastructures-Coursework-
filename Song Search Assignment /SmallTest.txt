Cry For Help 
She's taken my time
convinced hold me she's fine
but when she leaves I'm not so sure.

Rick Astley
Hold Me In Your Arms 
Hold hold hold We've been trying for a long time to say what we want to say
But feelings don't come easy to express in a simple way.
But we all have feelings
we all need loving
And who would be the fool to say that if you -
Hold me in your arms
I won#t feel better?

Number one song
